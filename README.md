# Transaction-Manager-OS
# Abstract
The "Transaction Manager" project focuses on the development of a modular system comprising five distinct programs—adder, subtractor, multiplier, divider, and transaction manager. The primary goal of this project is to implement efficient communication between these programs using Linux-based operating systems, terminal commands, and interprocess communication mechanisms.

# Project Topic
The project revolves around a Transaction Manager, acting as the central control unit. This manager initializes subprocesses (adder, subtractor, multiplier, divider) and establishes separate pipelines for each, facilitating communication between them. The subprocesses are designed to perform basic arithmetic operations “addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division” based on the user's input.
